SparcPoint.com WordNet Implementation in .NET

WordNet is a Lexical Dictionary created by Princeton University and is commonly used in NLP applications and Spell Checkers.
https://wordnet.princeton.edu/

There doesn't seem to be any good implementations of a WordNet library in .NET, less so in UWP (Universal Windows Platform).
So this project's aim is to create a solid WordNet implementation for UWP Applications (Specifically IoT).  The goal is to
have search capabilities along with sentence tokenizers and more.

Any suggestions are welcom.  I will hopefully be putting documentation externally on the SparcPoint.com site as blog entries.
